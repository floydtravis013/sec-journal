## Questions

- Summarize what you learned from the China's Spy Chip Reading 
    - Amazing to me that something smaller than the tip of a pencil can allow access to the computer from anybody, block downloading of security  updates.  It seems kind of silly to me that leaving devices in the computers would eventually lead to them being caught. Its also interesting to me that apple 
    wouldnt allow anybody into their servers or give them the infected hardware.
      
  -  Answer the following questions  
 
  - What is a CPU and Cores
      - A CPU is a central processing unit, that gives instructions to the rest of the computer. It controlls imputs and outputs of electricity to different parts of the computer. A core is the brain of the CPU. Cores increase the performance of the CPU. By having multiple "brains" being able to send instructions at the same time as other cores. The more cores, the faster the processor.
  - What is RAM why do computers use it.
      - Ram stores data used by running programs. So it allows your computer to access programs quicker. It allows you to access programs and files faster. The more RAM the better, but too much does nothing when you get to a point.

- Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

    -Learning exactly what makes a computer, how every part works together by sending signals blows my mind how far technology has come. And nothing compares to how small technology will become. if this was 6 almost 7 years ago and they were smaller than the tip of a pencil. Imagine in 10 or 15 years when we wont be able to distinguish video game from real life. or how small our computers will be.
