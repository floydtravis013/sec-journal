## Questions

- What do you believe is the most important Hard Skill and Why?

  -I believe Troubleshooting is the most important Hard skill. Being able to diagnose the problem, and find it seems like one of the most important. 

- What do you believe is the most important Soft Skill and Why?

  -I would say personal and communication skills are the most important. They go hand in hand. Being able to communicate what you're good at, or what you need to work at is super important. But getting along with others, and managing your stress and personal time are critical. You cant work in an environment where you cant communicate with your peers.
