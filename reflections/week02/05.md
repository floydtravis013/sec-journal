# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
  -I loved being able to write scripts, and learn how to make more things to mess with my buddies :)
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
  -You can create tasks, and events to have your computer do something at a specific time every day.
- What are you struggling with?
  -Learning how to write code is very difficult for me, having to set the destination and what exactly its supposed to do
- What would you count as a victory?

  - being able to understand commands and write consistant scripts. Everything is a new language to me right now
