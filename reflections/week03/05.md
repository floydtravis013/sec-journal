# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
Just like every week, i start worrying when i see what we have to do for our challenge, and just like last week as i started doing it, i realized i knew more than i thought

- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
I love learning about new ways to get into the computer. 

- What are you struggling with?
Remembering certain things is a problem for me, but everything we learn gets used the next day or the next week.

- What would you count as a victory?s
