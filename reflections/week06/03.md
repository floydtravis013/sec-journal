- Summarize the reading
Active Directory (AD) is a database and set of services that connect users with the network resources they need to get their work done.
A domain is a collection of objects (e.g. users, devices) that share the same Active Directory database. A domain is identified by a DNS name like company.com.
A tree is a collection of one or more domains with a contiguous namespace (they have a common DNS root name like marketing.company.com, engineering.company.com, and sales.company.com).
A forest is a collection of one or more trees that share a common schema, global catalog, and directory configuration—but aren’t part of a contiguous namespace. The forest typically serves as the security boundary for an enterprise network.

Extensibility – companies can easily organize Active Directory data to align with their organizational structure and business needs.
Simplicity – administrators can centrally manage user identities and access privileges across the enterprise, helping businesses simplify management and reduce operations expenses.
