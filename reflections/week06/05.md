# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? Active domain was really interesting to hear about, and to know that thats what they used on highschool computers. I'm really upset i didnt try to get more interested in computer networking in highschool. I took a networking course
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
it was suprising to see how companies and schools use active domain and the windows server to keep track of everything and give permissions to people
- What are you struggling with? I'm struggling keeping up with getting the correct settings. Thats the toughest thing for me is making sure you get the correct settings to get what you want.
- What would you count as a victory?
Being able to look at the windows server and know whats going on, and see which users access what, and settings GPO's on users.
