## Questions
- In your own words, summarize the key concepts covered in today's reading. Why are these concepts useful to a security practitioner, and what are its components?
IaaS can uniquely take advantage of how easy the cloud is to deploy and manage. With this incredible speed and power comes its own set of challenges, one of which is security — of which compliance is a subset.
the shared responsibility of security in the cloud also means you are responsible only for managing data, classifying assets, managing access, and cloud configurations — all while the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) manages the hardware and operations ancillary to their data centers.
The AWS Well-Architected Framework provides AWS users a guide to effectively architect solutions in the cloud. It provides a consistent benchmark for architects and evaluators that can aid in evaluating cloud systems in AWS.

Operational Excellence: Bringing value to the business
Security: Protecting assets, systems, and information in the cloud
Reliability: Recovering from disruptions and meet its demand
Performance Efficiency: Using resources efficiently as things evolve
Cost Optimization: Minimizing or eliminating unnecessary costs

The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Security Trust And Risk Assurance (STAR) is a comprehensive program for cloud security assurance. Having controls mapped to PCI DSS, ISO 27001, NIST, and ISACA COBIT, CSA STAR stores documentation of the security and privacy controls from major CSPs. 

By adhering to the STAR framework relevant to your CSP, your organization validates security posture and can demonstrate proof of secure cloud controls.
